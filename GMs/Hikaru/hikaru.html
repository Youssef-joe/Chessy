        <div class="box blue">One of Nakamura’s major strengths is his ability to think ahead many moves in a game: This, combined with his aggressive playing style, often leads to complex positions that are difficult for his opponents to navigate.</div>
        <div class="box red">Nakamura’s parents were both professional chess players: His father, Shigeru, is a 9-time Japanese Chess Champion, while his mother, Kiyoshi, is a two-time winner of the Women’s Japanese Chess Championship.</div>
        <div class="box yellow">In 2004, Nakamura was given the opportunity to play a four-game chess match against Grandmaster Evgeny Bareev. The prize for the best out of four was $100,000. Nakamura won two games and drew one game to win the match with one game left unresolved. However, he declined the prize money, saying that “chess is not a sport”.        </div>
        <div class="box green">Hikaru Nakamura is a very aggressive player with a style that can often be quite intimidating. This has resulted in him scoring some impressive wins, but also a few spectacular losses. Nonetheless, he is considered one of the strongest players in the world and is definitely one to watch!</div>
