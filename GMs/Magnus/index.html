        <div class="box blue">Schools in Norway have passionate instructors,
             but getting individual attention is difficult. As a result, Magnus’
             parents decided to home-school their children for at least half a year or a year while they traveled for a year!</div>
        <div class="box red">Carlsen earned his second Grand Master 
            norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February.
             On March 17, 2004, Anatoly Karpov lost to Magnus Carlsen in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík,
             Iceland.</div>
        <div class="box yellow">When Carlsen was six years old,
             he faced off against Kasparov before a crowd of thousands. After the game, he had ice cream at McDonald’s. In 2009, five years after the duel,
             Kasparov became his trainer.</div>
        <div class="box green">Magnus Carlsen has a rating of 2882, which is the highest ever recorded by a grandmaster. When he was just 23 years old, Magnus achieved the highest Elo rating. Magnus Carlsen is considered to be the most skilled chess player in history. He could potentially reach the 2900 Elo mark in the near future.</div>
