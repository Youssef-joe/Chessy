        <div class="box blue">Ding was born in China's Wenzhou in 1992. His parents named him 'Liren,' picking the word from their favorite Confucian saying: "Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others." </div>
        <div class="box red">Speaking to CGTN Europe in an exclusive interview last year, Ding spilled the beans on some of his creature comforts when he's away from home. 

            Whenever he travels abroad, he brings a pot to cook his porridge in. "I was too lazy to go out to eat at noon!" he said.
            
            The chess champ also tends to take books with him. He likes reading novels, having particularly enjoyed Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet. 
            
            The things he tends to miss the most when away from home are walking near his house and eating a small yellow fish dish that he likes to eat in Wenzhou (when he's in Europe, he likes to stock up on paninis and lasagne).</div>
        <div class="box yellow">While Ding's success can be attributed to his natural skill, hard work, and the efforts of his fore-bearers to put China on the chess map, he has some surprisingly simple advice for those wanting to get into the game. 

            "For beginners, you have to buy good looking chess pieces," he told CGTN. "Go into the game from a point of appreciation first, and get some fun and pleasure out of it."</div>
        <div class="box green">While Ding rose through the chess ranks, it was also apparent he was a solid student with academic promise.

            His father, Ding Wenjun, says that before 2009, he and his wife had considered the now reigning world champ to be "a student who could play chess."</div>
